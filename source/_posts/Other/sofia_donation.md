## Help Sofia Lead a Pain-Free Life

Sofia is a **12-year-old girl** battling a severe case of scoliosis. Despite enduring numerous treatments such as wearing a corset and undergoing physical therapy, her condition has not improved. The only remaining solution is a **complex surgical intervention**.

This life-changing surgery will take place at **Monza Hospital in Bucharest**, but the cost is overwhelming: **30,000 EUR**. Your support can give Sofia the chance to live a pain-free and healthy life.

- **54° curvature** between T6-T12
- **42° curvature** between T12-L4
