## Putting it all together

## A packet's journey:

User Request from the Internet:
    A user types in the domain (e.g., smcc2024.com) in their browser or directly accesses the IP address (.67 or .69).

DNS Resolution (if using domain):
    If using a domain (smcc2024.com), the request goes to the DNS server (likely Cloudflare).
    DNS resolves the domain to the corresponding public IP address (.67 or .69).

Packet Leaves User's Device:
    The packet leaves the user's device and travels through the internet, reaching your network via the ISP.

Arrival at the ESXi Host:
    The packet arrives at the physical NICs (.67 or .69) of your ESXi host.

Routing through IPFire:
    The packet is received by IPFire, which acts as a router/firewall.
    IPFire checks the packet against firewall rules to determine its destination based on the target IP (.67 or .69).

Routing to Web Server (.69) or Challenges (.67):
- If the packet is destined for the web server (.69): 
    IPFire routes it to the Web Server VM (.69).
    The packet reaches the Web Server VM's internal NIC.

- If the packet is destined for the challenges (.67):
    IPFire routes it to the Challenges VM (.67).
    The packet reaches the Challenges VM's internal NIC.

Nginx Proxy (Web Server .69):
    If the packet is for the web server, it arrives at the Web Server VM's internal NIC.
    Nginx proxy (running on the Web Server VM) intercepts the packet if it's on port 80.
    Nginx then forwards the request to the appropriate service (e.g., CTFd container running on port 8000).

Accessing Challenges (.67):
    If the packet is for a challenge:
        The packet arrives at the Challenges VM's internal NIC.
        Docker routes the packet to the relevant container based on the exposed port for that challenge.

Response Packet Journey:
    After processing the request, the response packet follows a similar path in reverse to reach the user's device, passing through the network components in reverse order.

Summary:

The packet's journey involves traversing various network components, starting from the user's request, passing through the internet, hitting the ESXi host, being routed by IPFire, and reaching the specific VM (Web Server or Challenges) based on the destination IP and port. The response packet then follows a similar path back to the user's device. Each step involves network routing, firewall checks, and service-specific handling to fulfill the user's request or access to the challenges.
