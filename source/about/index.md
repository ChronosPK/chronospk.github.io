## Intro

Hello! My name is <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/radumarin001/" target="_blank"><b>Radu</b></a> and I am an officer in Romanian Army. I recently finished my studies at <a href="https://www.armyacademy.ro/" target="_blank"><b>"Nicolae Balcescu" Land Forces Academy</b></a> in Sibiu, specializing in military communication, information technology and cyber defense. I embarked on my cybersecurity journey in 2021, driven by a relentless thirst for knowledge, improvement, and a desire to contribute positively to the community.

At the moment, I am certified with `eJPT` and aspire to get the `OSCP` by the end of 2025. I am continually exploring, learning, and sharing insights in the expansive and dynamic realm of cybersecurity.

<br>

## 2 CTFs

My engagement with cybersecurity materialized through organizing Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, aimed at challenging and educating participants in various aspects of cybersecurity. My inaugural event, <a href="/categories/CTFs/SMCC-2023" target="_blank"><b>Sibiu Military Cyber Challenge 2023</b> (SMCC 2023)</a>, was a beginner-intermediate level CTF designed for my peers in the military academy and high school in Sibiu, Romania.

Following its success, I created the <a href="/categories/CTFs/CSCTF-2024/" target="_blank"><b>Chronos Security CTF 2024</b> CSCTF 2024</a>, a national competition welcoming participants across all educational levels, from high school to master's degree students, across military and civilian sectors, as well as other interested Romanian participants. The competition is structured to encourage learning, enhance skills, and foster a supportive community environment. This initiative not only served as a significant challenge but also as a comprehensive project for my bachelor thesis.

## Projects

From July 2022 to July 2024 I had been developing a website based on **Notion** (awesome note-taking app). There, I posted writeups to CTFs and machines, cheatsheets, learning resources, tricks and tools, scripts, and explained how I created the first CTF, **SMCC 2023**. In the meantime, I also developed a cool script to automate the process of enumeration with `terminator` (<a href="https://github.com/ChronosPk/APET" target="_">APET</a>), published some <a href="https://github.com/ChronosPk/pentesting-cheatsheets" target="_">pentesting cheatsheets</a>, and some other smaller projects.

<br>

## Development

In the beginning, I liked every branch or cybersecurity, so I tried to learn everything. This strategy proved inefficient from its early days, after which I started taking predefined learning paths, like the ones offered by THM or Cisco. After *many* courses, countless studying hours, handful of pwned machines and solved CTF challenges, and whoever knows what else, I might be an advanced script kiddie (*everyone in cybersecurity, battling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" target="_">impostor syndrome</a>*).

<br>

## Next steps

Additionally to getting the `OSCP`, I'm committed to creating more engaging and educational CTF competitions, contributing to cybersecurity awareness, and supporting the growth of this vibrant community. Looking forward to more pentesting, awareness and teaching!

<br>
